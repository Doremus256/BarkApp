Use Case:
<br>
<br>
SWIM Team is tired of spreadsheets. The most basic and widespread way of managing an organization’s inventory levels involves intimate knowledge of Excel and related formulas. Our motivation here is to circumvent the need for Excel within an organization by providing procurement teams with a simple, reliable and easy to use alternative called “SWIM”.
<br>
<br>
Users will be able to populate two tables. The first with items used by their organization, and their corresponding monthly usage quantities. After providing SWIM with a monthly budget amount, SWIM will allow users to update inventory levels as items are used, which will automatically update the table. From the item list, users will be able to select an option to display “preferred vendor” information for a specific item, including price and number of days to delivery. 
<br>
<br>
The modular nature of this application will allow for easy adoption by any organization in any industry. The leg work solely consists of updating the database used by a particular organization’s procurement team.
